## üéì Key Concepts

### Atomic File Operations
Files are written to a temporary location first, then renamed to the final name. This ensures files are never partially written.

### Error Logging
All errors are logged with:
- Timestamp
- Error message
- Stack trace (for debugging)
- Context (what was being attempted)

### Input Validation
All inputs are validated before processing:
- Required fields checked
- Data types validated
- Value ranges checked (e.g., prices > 0)

### Graceful Degradation
System continues running even when errors occur:
- Errors are logged
- Bad files moved to CORRUPT_*
- Transient failures retried
- No silent failures

## üöÄ Quick Start Commands

### View a specific document
```bash
cd /mnt/project/docs
cat QUICK_REFERENCE.md
```

### Search for specific information
```bash
cd /mnt/project/docs
grep -i "atomic" *.md
grep -i "testing" *.md
```

### Check file sizes
```bash
ls -lh /mnt/project/docs/
```
