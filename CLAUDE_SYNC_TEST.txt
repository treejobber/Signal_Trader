Created at: $(date)

This means:
âœ… Changes I make in /mnt/project show up in your local repo
âœ… We can work directly without downloads

If you SEE this file:
- Reply "YES, I see the test file"
- We'll set up automatic commits

If you DON'T see this file:
- Reply "NO, I don't see it"
- We'll use the patch system instead
